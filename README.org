#+TITLE: UwUnyaa's dotifiles

This repository contains some of my dotfiles. Certain ones make no sense to be
contained within this repo, for example suckless software.

The following scripts handle setting up symlinks outside of the repository.
They're intended for use with GNU bash and GNU stow.

Config files are located within the =home= directory of the repo, which is
matching where they will be symlinked to, including their subdirectories.

* These tools have dotfiles in this repo:
- =startx= (=~/.xinitrc=)
- =dunst=
- =foot=
- =kvantum=
- GNU =bash=
- GNU =readline=
- =GIMP=
- =lxterminal=
- =pcmanfm=
- =zeal=
- =htop=

* Installing:
Just run
#+begin_src sh
  ./install
#+end_src

The script is written in GNU bash and depends on GNU stow to run. In case
you're on arch, the package's names are simply =bash= and =stow=. Both are GNU
software, so they should be to install or even build from source on just about
anything.
